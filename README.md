# VolunteerMatch Pair Programming Interview Exercises

## Goal 

These pair programming interview exercises are public because the goal of pairing in an interview is NOT to test prior CS knowledge but to see what it's like to work through a problem with someone building out a piece of functionality using an outside-in TDD (aka BDD) approach. If you discover these on Github before your interview then bonus points to you for doing your homework. You can be sure we've checked out your github account too :-)

## Contributing

If you have pair programming interview problems you like to do in any language feel free to fork this, add them, and send pull requests. It would be great to build out a repository of fun pair programming interview exercises in many languages.

## Getting started

See README in each project for suggestions/ideas
