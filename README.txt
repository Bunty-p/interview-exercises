These pair programming interview exercises are public because the goal of pairing in an interview is NOT to test prior CS knowledge but to see what it's like to work through a problem with someone. If you discover these on Github before your interview then bonus points to you for doing your homework. You can be sure we've checked out your github account too :-)

If you have pair programming interview problems you like to do in any language feel free to fork this, add them, and send pull requests.

See README.txt in each project for suggestions/ideas
